## bzip2

In VS2005 EXPRESS EDITION - ENU a libbz2.dsp file was opened and a .vcproj
file generated, which was then copied into an extracted bzip2-1.0.6 folder
on another machine and opened in VS2017 COMMUNITY EDITION, which generated
these two files.

I presume Yoshioka Tsuneo (吉岡 恒夫) is the author of the libbz2.dsp file.
